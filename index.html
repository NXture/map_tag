            <h2>About India</h2>
            <p>The seventh-largest country by area, India is located on the Indian subcontinent in South Asia.</p>
            <p>India was home to the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, and is the birthplace of four world religions: Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism. 
                India endured colonisation, eventually being administered by the United Kingdom from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century.</p>
            <p>India became an independent nation in 1947 after a struggle for independence that was mainly non-violent resistance, 
                led by influential figures like Mahatma Gandhi, and underwent a violent partition. India is the second-most populous
                country with over 1.2 billion people, and is also the most populous democracy in the world.</p>
